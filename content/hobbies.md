## Beyond mathematics

![](/drawing.png)

In the limited time when I'm not doing math, I have a lot of hobbies, which include (but are not restricted to):

+ Fine art (Chinese painting, calligraphy, pen and ink drawings, etc.)
+ Literature (poetry, fictions, literary critiques)
+ Beijing Opera 

If you are an aspiring artist or writer too, welcome to stop by and have a chat! A nonacademic webpage/blog is under construction. Stay tuned.
