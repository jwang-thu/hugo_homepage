This course is a one semester course meant to introduce graduate students from science and engineering disciplines to the fundamentals of numerical mathematics. (But any graduate student seriously interested in applied mathematics should take it.) It will be an introductory course covering a broad range of topics such as: interpolation, numerical differentiation, numerical quadrature, linear systems, and least squares problems. Advanced topics such as approximation theory, fast algorithms, and eigenvalue problems will also be covered either in the form of extended readings or invited talks. 

### Office hour

### Prerequisites

+ Required
  + Calculus
  + Linear algebra
  + Some experience in programming 
+ Highly recommended
  + Mathematical analysis
  + Complex Variables
+ Recommeded
  + Ordinary Differential Equations
  + Partial Differential Equations

### Textbook

The course textbook is *Scientific Computing - An Introduction Using Maple and MATLAB* by W. Gander, M.J. Gander, and F. Kwok.
It is available for download in [PDF format](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-04325-8).

### Recommended Texts

+ [*Numerical Mathematics (2nd ed.)*](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98885) by A. Quarteroni, R. Sacco and F. Saleri
+ *Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice* by L. N. Trefethen
+ *Numerical Linear Algebra* by L.N. Trefethen and D. Bau III 

### Assignments and grading

There will be weekly homework assignments involving a mix of theory and (small-scale) computational experiments and a (closed-book) final exam. 

Since the emphasis is on developing the ability of problem solving and effective communication between disciplines, none of the above is meant to be 
heavily mathematical. However scientific rigor to some extent is to be expected (as it should be).
